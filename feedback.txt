* Code

Tidy and elegant code (but you're right that leftOf and rightOf are a little cumbersome).

There are some unnamed constants in ngram-model.py such as 28.

* Report

Good observations are made in the (short) report.

The introduction of errors in test material you describe as an extra, but it is of course what one expects in the experiments: to use the same model to introduce errors that is also used to correct the errors.

Did Laplace smoothing affect the accuracy (provided you can find an alternative solution to the Key Value error, which should be easy)? It is regrettable you did not
investigate this.

The README file is empty.

* General comments

Extras include cross-validation, Laplace smoothing, an attempt to generalise to any N.
